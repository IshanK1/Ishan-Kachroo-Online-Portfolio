 <!--The code (below) displays a navbar at the top of the page. Users can navigate between the different pages using the navbar instead of going back to the PHP everytime they want to view a different page. The navbar is in a container so that it doesn't span the whole screen, and the "active element" has been applied to the nav-item the user has selected, so that the user will see the page they are on highlighted in blue. The class "nav-pills" is used to syle how a nav-item looks when selected, and provides a box sourounding the item when selected. The class "nav-fill" is used so that the navbar will fill out the entire container, instead of leaving empty space to the right.  -->
